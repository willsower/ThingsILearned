Just an area where I put things I learned

Create an environment in terminal by using export, for example if I wanted to create an environment variable called email and set it, I would do the following command.

`export EMAIL=myemail@gmail.com`

To read the variable I could do 

`echo $EMAIL`

I also made this in the bash mini shell, but I forgot how to do it myself haha
